# Team-Databytes

The databytes team is a group of four Data Scientists; Phil Cork, Julia Piscionere, Dylan Waks, and Allison Hansen. 

We spent the semester of our CSCI 462 captstone class contributing to an open source software titled SciKit-Learn, an industry standard for a variation of statistical modeling and data processing. 

Please see the relevant files for our final presentation on our challenges, experiences and opportunities.
